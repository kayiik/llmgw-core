// Package anonymous runs the automation that connects the reviewed
// anonymous providers, as the gateway's does: it enrolls each profile's
// provider, discovers what its catalog admits, probes the models with a
// completion and publishes the exact targets that answered.
//
// Policy and persistence stay product code, behind Hooks: whether the
// automation runs, enrolling a provider in the product's configuration,
// the durable claim that checks a provider once a day, the evidence
// generation, and keeping the results. Catalogs and probes go through
// the product's Catalog and Invoker, typically its runtime.Runtime, so
// each provider is read and invoked by its own vertical, with the
// vertical's anonymous admission and the instance's resilience policy.
//
// It replaces providers.AutoConnectAnonymousProviders and
// providers.NewAnonymousOpenAICompatibleAdapter, which read catalogs and
// send probes with their own HTTP client.
