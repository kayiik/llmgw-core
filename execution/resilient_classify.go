// TransientClassification reads err as the gateway's resilience wrapper

// It is opt-in: core's own reading, which the executors and the default
// Observe use, stays as it is.
//
// It is err's own classification, with the gateway's reading of an
// upstream status. Of the statuses that refuse a request, only 408, 429,
// 500, 502, 503 and 504 are transient, so only they repeat and count
// against the circuit; any other ends the streak. Core's own reading
// repeats every 5xx, and counts neither 408 nor 429.
//
// Every failure that repeats counts against the circuit, a transport
// failure included. A failure without a status, an answer the upstream
// sent that could not be used, which carries a 2xx, and an operation its
// caller gave up on keep their own reading. Failover and RetryAfter stay
// err's own.
